Chell PHP Portal
================
&copy; 2022, Jos Nienhuis

I created this project to have an easy to use portal for my homeserver. 
It aggregates different services and webapplications that I want easily accessible from within this portal.

Take a look at the wiki to find out how to setup this project.
