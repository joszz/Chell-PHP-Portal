Chell PHP Portal
================
Copyright (c), 2015-2016, Jos Nienhuis (jos_nienhuis@hotmail.com)

This project I created to have a easy to use portal for my homeserver. 
It aggregates different services and webapplications that I want easily accessible from within this portal.
The current state of the project is still very much a work in progress. 
Some functionality might not yet be fully decoupled from my own setup but the goal is to work toward this and have a generic solution for anyone.

Prerequisites
-------------
- PHP 5.x
- MySQL 5.x
- Phalcon PHP framework 2.x

Installation and configuration
